# Template: Hadoop by HTTP

## Template ID
10363

## Description
The template gets the Hadoop metrics from cluster's hosts (ResourceManager, NodeManagers, NameNode, DataNodes) by HTTP agent. You should define the IP address (or FQDN) and Web-UI port for the ResourceManager in {$HADOOP.RESOURCEMANAGER.HOST} and {$HADOOP.RESOURCEMANAGER.PORT} macros and for the NameNode in {$HADOOP.NAMENODE.HOST} and {$HADOOP.NAMENODE.PORT} macros respectively. Macros can be set in the template or overridden at the host level.
