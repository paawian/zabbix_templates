# Template: Zookeeper by HTTP

## Template ID
10369

## Description
This template is designed for the effortless deployment of Apache Zookeeper monitoring by Zabbix via HTTP and doesn't require any external scripts.

This template works with standalone and cluster instances. Metrics are collected from each Zookeeper node by requests to AdminServer

Setup:

1. Enable the AdminServer and configure the parameters according to the official documentation:
https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_adminserver_config

2. Set the hostname or IP address of the Apache Zookeeper host in the '{$ZOOKEEPER.HOST}' macro. You can also change the '{$ZOOKEEPER.COMMAND_URL}', '{$ZOOKEEPER.PORT}' and '{$ZOOKEEPER.SCHEME}' macros if necessary.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum:
