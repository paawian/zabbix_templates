## Items

### Item: Battery capacity
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The remaining battery capacity expressed as
 percentage of full capacity.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: External battery packs count
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The number of external battery packs connected to the UPS. If
 the UPS does not use smart cells then the agent reports
 ERROR_NO_SUCH_NAME.
- **Interval**: 1h
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Battery last replace date
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The date when the UPS system's batteries were last replaced
 in mm/dd/yy (or yyyy) format. For Smart-UPS models, this value
 is originally set at the factory. When the UPS batteries
 are replaced, this value should be reset by the administrator.
 For Symmetra PX 250/500 this OID is read-only and is configurable in the local display only.
- **Interval**: 1h
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Battery replace indicator
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
Indicates whether the UPS batteries need replacement.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Battery runtime remaining
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The UPS battery run time remaining before battery
 exhaustion.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Battery status
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The status of the UPS batteries. A batteryLow(3) value
 indicates the UPS will be unable to sustain the current
 load, and its services will be lost if power is not restored.
 The amount of run time in reserve at the time of low battery
 can be configured by the upsAdvConfigLowBatteryRunTime.
 A batteryInFaultCondition(4)value indicates that a battery
 installed has an internal error condition.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Battery temperature
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current internal UPS temperature in Celsius.
Temperatures below zero read as 0.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Battery voltage
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The actual battery bus voltage in Volts.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Input fail cause
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The reason for the occurrence of the last transfer to UPS
battery power.  The variable is set to:
- noTransfer(1) -- if there is no transfer yet.
- highLineVoltage(2) -- if the transfer to battery is caused
by an over voltage greater than the high transfer voltage.
- brownout(3) -- if the duration of the outage is greater than
five seconds and the line voltage is between 40% of the
rated output voltage and the low transfer voltage.
- blackout(4) -- if the duration of the outage is greater than five
seconds and the line voltage is between 40% of the rated
output voltage and ground.
- smallMomentarySag(5) -- if the duration of the outage is less
than five seconds and the line voltage is between 40% of the
rated output voltage and the low transfer voltage.
- deepMomentarySag(6) -- if the duration of the outage is less
than five seconds and the line voltage is between 40% of the
rated output voltage and ground.  The variable is set to
- smallMomentarySpike(7) -- if the line failure is caused by a
rate of change of input voltage less than ten volts per cycle.
- largeMomentarySpike(8) -- if the line failure is caused by
a rate of change of input voltage greater than ten volts per cycle.
- selfTest(9) -- if the UPS was commanded to do a self test.
- rateOfVoltageChange(10) -- if the failure is due to the rate of change of
the line voltage.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Input frequency
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current input frequency to the UPS system in Hz.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Input voltage
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current utility line voltage in VAC.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Output current
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current in amperes drawn by the load on the UPS.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Output load
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current UPS load expressed as percentage
of rated capacity.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Output status
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The current state of the UPS. If the UPS is unable to
 determine the state of the UPS this variable is set
 to unknown(1).
During self-test most UPSes report onBattery(3) but
 some that support it will report onBatteryTest(15).
 To determine self-test status across all UPSes, refer
 to the upsBasicStateOutputState OID.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Output voltage
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The output voltage of the UPS system in VAC.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: SNMP traps (fallback)
- **Description**: The item is used to collect all SNMP traps unmatched by other snmptrap items
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 2

### Item: System contact details
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed
node, together with information on how to contact this person.  If no contact
information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: System description
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB

include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and
networking software.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (hardware)
- **Description**: MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
The amount of time since this host was last initialized. Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System location
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').  If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Model
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
The UPS model name (e.g. 'APC Smart-UPS 600').
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: System name
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
An administratively-assigned name for this managed node.By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.  If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (network)
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System object ID
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Serial number
- **Description**: MIB: PowerNet-MIB
An 8-character string identifying the serial number of
 the UPS internal microprocessor.  This number is set at
 the factory.  NOTE: This number does NOT correspond to
 the serial number on the rear of the UPS.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: SNMP agent availability
- **Description**: Availability of SNMP checks on the host. The value of this item corresponds to availability icons in the host list.
Possible values:
0 - not available
1 - available
2 - unknown
