## Items

### Item: ClassLoading: Loaded class count
- **Description**: Displays number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: ClassLoading: Total loaded class count
- **Description**: Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: ClassLoading: Unloaded class count
- **Description**: Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Compilation: Name of the current JIT compiler
- **Description**: Displays the total number of classes unloaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Compilation: Accumulated time spent
- **Description**: Displays the approximate accumulated elapsed time spent in compilation, in seconds.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Memory: Heap memory committed
- **Description**: Current heap memory allocated. This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Memory: Heap memory maximum size
- **Description**: Maximum amount of heap that can be used for memory management. This amount of memory is not guaranteed to be available if it is greater than the amount of committed memory. The Java virtual machine may fail to allocate memory even if the amount of used memory does not exceed this maximum size.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Memory: Heap memory used
- **Description**: Current memory usage outside the heap.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Memory: Non-Heap memory committed
- **Description**: Current memory allocated outside the heap. This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Memory: Non-Heap memory maximum size
- **Description**: Maximum amount of non-heap memory that can be used for memory management. This amount of memory is not guaranteed to be available if it is greater than the amount of committed memory. The Java virtual machine may fail to allocate memory even if the amount of used memory does not exceed this maximum size.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Memory: Non-Heap memory used
- **Description**: Current memory usage outside the heap
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Memory: Object pending finalization count
- **Description**: The approximate number of objects for which finalization is pending.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: OperatingSystem: File descriptors maximum count
- **Description**: This is the number of file descriptors we can have opened in the same process, as determined by the operating system. You can never have more file descriptors than this number.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: OperatingSystem: File descriptors opened
- **Description**: This is the number of opened file descriptors at the moment, if this reaches the MaxFileDescriptorCount, the application will throw an IOException: Too many open files. This could mean you are opening file descriptors and never closing them.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: OperatingSystem: Process CPU Load
- **Description**: ProcessCpuLoad represents the CPU load in this process.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Runtime: JVM version
- **Description**: 
- **Interval**: 1h
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Threading: Daemon thread count
- **Description**: Number of daemon threads running.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Threading: Peak thread count
- **Description**: Maximum number of threads being executed at the same time since the JVM was started or the peak was reset.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Threading: Thread count
- **Description**: The number of threads running at the current moment.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Threading: Total started thread count
- **Description**: The number of threads started since the JVM was launched.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 3
