| System contact details | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB.<br>The textual identification of the contact person for the managed node (or: this node), together with the contact information of this person. If no contact information is known, the value is a zero-length string. | system.contact | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System description | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB.<br>The textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification number of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and the networking software. | system.descr | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| Hardware model name | MIB: ENTITY-MIB. | system.hw.model | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| Hardware serial number | MIB: ENTITY-MIB. | system.hw.serialnumber | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System location | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB.<br>The physical location of this node (e.g., telephone closet, the third floor).<br>If the location is unknown, the value is a zero-length string. | system.location | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System name | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB.<br>The administratively-assigned name for this node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is a zero-length string. | system.name | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System object ID | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB.<br>The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprise's subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining "what kind of box" is being managed.<br>For example, if the vendor "Flintstones, Inc." was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its "Fred Router". | system.objectid | SNMP_AGENT | no delay |
| Operating system | MIB: CISCO-IMAGE-MIB | system.sw.os | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| Uptime (snmp) | MIB: SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB::snmpEngineTime.<br>The number of seconds since the value of the `snmpEngineBoots` object has had a last change.<br>When incrementing this object's value would cause it to exceed its maximum, the `snmpEngineBoots` is incremented as if a re-initialization had occurred,<br>and this object's value consequently reverts to zero. | system.uptime | SNMP_AGENT | no delay |

These MIB objects are not accurate because they look at the CPU with an interval of one minute and five seconds, respectively. These MIBs enable to monitor the trends and plan the capacity of your network. The recommended baseline rising threshold for the `cpmCPUTotal5minRev` is 90 percent. Depending on the platform, some routers that run at 90 percent, for example, 2500 series can exhibit performance degradation versus a high-end router, for example, the 7500 series, which can operate fine. | system.cpu.util[{#SNMPINDEX}] | SNMP_AGENT |

### Items

| name | description | key | type |
| ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| {#SNMPVALUE}: Temperature sensor status | MIB: CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB.<br>The object name: entSensorStatus.<br>This variable indicates the present operational status of the sensor.<br>Possible values:<br>-  ok (1): means the agent can read the sensor value;<br>-  unavailable (2): means that the agent presently can not report the sensor value;<br>-  nonoperational (3) means that the agent believes the sensor is broken. The sensor could have a hard failure (e.g., disconnected wire), or a soft failure (e.g., out-of-range, jittery, or wildly fluctuating readings). | sensor.temp.status[{#SNMPINDEX}] | SNMP_AGENT |
| {#SNMPVALUE}: Temperature | MIB: CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB.<br>The object name: entSensorValue.<br>This variable reports the most recent measurement seen by the sensor. | sensor.temp.value[{#SNMPINDEX}] | SNMP_AGENT |
