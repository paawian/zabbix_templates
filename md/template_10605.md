# Template: HPE iLO by HTTP

## Template ID
10605

## Description
This template is designed for the effortless deployment of HPE iLO monitoring by Zabbix via iLO RESTful API and doesn't require any external scripts.

Setup:

1. Create the iLO user for monitoring (for example, `zbx_monitor`). The user will only need to have the `Login` privilege, which can be assigned manually or by assigning the `ReadOnly` role to the user.
2. Set the iLO API endpoint URL in the `{$ILO.URL}` macro in the format `<scheme>://<host>[:port]/` (port is optional).
3. Set the name of the user that you created in step 1 in the `{$ILO.USER}` macro.
4. Set the password of the user that you created in step 1 in the `{$ILO.PASSWORD}` macro.
