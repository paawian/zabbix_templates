## Items

### Item: Database availability
- **Description**: The database is available for connections in the given minute.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: DB block changes
- **Description**: The number of changes that were part of an update or delete operation that were made to all blocks in the SGA.
Such changes generate redo log entries and thus become permanent changes to the database if the transaction is committed.
This statistic approximates total database work and indicates the rate at which buffers are being dirtied during the selected time interval.

- **Description**: The number of failed database connections.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: CPU utilization, in %

- **Description**: The number of parse failures during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Parse count (hard)
- **Description**: The number of parse calls (real parses) during the selected time interval. A hard parse is an expensive operation in terms of memory use as it requires Oracle to allocate a workheap and other memory structures and then build a parse tree.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Parse count (total)
- **Description**: The number of hard and soft parses during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Physical read total bytes
- **Description**: The size in bytes of disk reads by all database instance activity including application reads, backup and recovery, and other utilities during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Physical reads
- **Description**: The number of data blocks read from disk during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Physical write total bytes
- **Description**: The size in bytes of all disk writes for the database instance including application activity, backup and recovery, and other utilities during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Physical writes
- **Description**: The number of data blocks written to disk during the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: Queued statements

- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: DB time
- **Description**: The amount of time database user sessions spend executing database code (CPU time + wait time). Database time is used to infer database call latency as it increases in direct proportion to both database call latency (response time) and call volume.
It is calculated as the average rate of accumulation of database time by foreground sessions in the database over the selected time interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Transaction count

- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: User commits
- **Description**: The number of user commits during the selected time interval. When a user commits a transaction, the generated redo that reflects the changes made to database blocks must be written to disk. Commits often represent the closest thing to a user transaction rate.
- **Interval**: 0
