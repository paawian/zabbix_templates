### Item: Get alarms check
- **Description**: Data collection check.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Disk: Binlog Usage

### Item: Burst balance
- **Description**: The percent of General Purpose SSD (gp2) burst-bucket I/O credits available.

### Item: Credit CPU: Balance
- **Description**: The number of CPU credits that an instance has accumulated, reported at 5-minute intervals.
You can use this metric to determine how long a DB instance can burst beyond its baseline performance level at a given rate.
When an instance is running, credits in the CPUCreditBalance don't expire. When the instance stops, the CPUCreditBalance does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost.

This metric applies only to db.t2.small and db.t2.medium instances for Aurora MySQL, and to db.t3 instances for Aurora PostgreSQL.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Credit CPU: Usage
- **Description**: The number of CPU credits consumed during the specified period, reported at 5-minute intervals.
This metric measures the amount of time during which physical CPUs have been used for processing instructions by virtual CPUs allocated to the DB instance.

This metric applies only to db.t2.small and db.t2.medium instances for Aurora MySQL, and to db.t3 instances for Aurora PostgreSQL
