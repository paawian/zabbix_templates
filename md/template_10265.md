# Template: Apache by HTTP

## Template ID
10265

## Description
This template is designed for the effortless deployment of Apache monitoring by Zabbix via HTTP and doesn't require any external scripts.

The template collects metrics by polling 'mod_status' with HTTP agent remotely.

Setup:

1. See the setup instructions for mod_status:
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_status.html

Check the availability of the module with this command line:
httpd -M 2>/dev/null | grep status_module

This is an example configuration of the Apache web server:

<Location "/server-status">
  SetHandler server-status
  Require host example.com
</Location>

2. Set the hostname or IP address of the Apache status page host in the '{$APACHE.STATUS.HOST}' macro. You can also change the status page port in the '{$APACHE.STATUS.PORT}' macro and status page path in the '{$APACHE.STATUS.PATH}' macro if necessary.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback/384764-discussion-thread-for-official-zabbix-template-apache

Generated by official Zabbix template tool "Templator"
