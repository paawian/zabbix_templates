# Template: Apache Cassandra by JMX

## Template ID
10370

## Description
The template to monitor Apache Cassandra by Zabbix that work without any external scripts.
It works with both standalone and cluster instances.
The metrics are collected by JMX.
You can set {$CASSANDRA.USER} and {$CASSANDRA.PASSWORD} macros in the template for using on the host level.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback/410057-discussion-thread-for-official-zabbix-template-apache-cassandra
