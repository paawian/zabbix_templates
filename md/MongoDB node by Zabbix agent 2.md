# MongoDB node by Zabbix agent 2 template description

Get MongoDB metrics from plugin for the zabbix-agent2.
  1. Setup and configure zabbix-agent2 compiled with the MongoDB monitoring plugin.
  2. Set the {$MONGODB.CONNSTRING} such as <protocol(host:port)> or named session.
  3. Set the user name and password in host macros ({$MONGODB.USER}, {$MONGODB.PASSWORD}) if you want to override parameters from the Zabbix agent configuration file.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback/420659-discussion-thread-for-official-zabbix-template-db-mongodb
