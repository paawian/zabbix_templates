# HashiCorp Consul Node by HTTP template description

Get HashiCorp Consul Node metrics by HTTP agent from metrics endpoint.

Don't forget to change macros {$CONSUL.NODE.API.URL}, {$CONSUL.TOKEN}.
Some metrics may not be collected depending on your HashiCorp Consul instance version and configuration.
More information about metrics you can find in official documentation: https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/telemetry

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback
