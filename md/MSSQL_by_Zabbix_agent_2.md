# MSSQL by Zabbix agent 2 template description

This template is designed for the effortless deployment of MSSQL monitoring by Zabbix via Zabbix agent 2 and uses a loadable plugin to run SQL queries.

Setup:

1. Deploy Zabbix agent 2 with the MSSQL plugin. You can use this template starting with Zabbix versions 6.0.27 / 6.4.12.

  For more information, see MSSQL plugin documentation: https://git.zabbix.com/projects/AP/repos/mssql/browse
  
  Loadable plugin requires installation of one of the following:

  - Separate package
  
  - Binary file
  
  - Compilation from sources: https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.0/manual/extensions/plugins/build

2. Create an MSSQL user for monitoring.

  View Server State and View Any Definition permissions should be granted to the user.
  Grant this user read permissions to the sysjobschedules, sysjobhistory, and sysjobs tables.

  For more information, see MSSQL documentation:
  
  - Create a database user: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-database-user?view=sql-server-ver16
  
  - GRANT Server Permissions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-server-permissions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16
  
  - Configure a User to Create and Manage SQL Server Agent Jobs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/configure-a-user-to-create-and-manage-sql-server-agent-jobs?view=sql-server-ver16

3. Set the user name and password in the host macros ({$MSSQL.USER} and {$MSSQL.PASSWORD}).

4. Set the connection string for the MSSQL instance in the {$MSSQL.URI} macro as a URI, such as <protocol://host:port>, or specify the named session - <sessionname>.

The "Service's TCP port state" item uses the {$MSSQL.HOST} and {$MSSQL.PORT} macros to check the availability of the MSSQL instance, change these if necessary.

Note: You can use the context macros {$MSSQL.BACKUP_FULL.USED}, {$MSSQL.BACKUP_LOG.USED}, and {$MSSQL.BACKUP_DIFF.USED} to disable backup age triggers for a certain database. If set to a value other than "1", the trigger expression for the backup age will not fire.

Generated by official Zabbix template tool "Templator"

## Items
| name | description | key | type | delay |
| ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Get Access Methods counters | The item gets server information about access methods. | mssql.access_methods.raw | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Auto-param attempts per second | Number of auto-parameterization attempts per second. The total should be the sum of the failed, safe, and unsafe auto-parameterizations. Auto-parameterization occurs when an instance of SQL Server tries to parameterize a Transact-SQL request by replacing some literals with parameters so that reuse of the resulting cached execution plan across multiple similar-looking requests is possible. Note that auto-parameterizations are also known as simple parameterizations in the newer versions of SQL Server. This counter does not include forced parameterizations. | mssql.autoparam_attempts_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Get availability groups | The item gets availability group states - name, primary and secondary health, synchronization health. | mssql.availability.group.get["{$MSSQL.URI}","{$MSSQL.USER}","{$MSSQL.PASSWORD}"] | no type | no delay |
| Average latch wait time | Average latch wait time (in milliseconds) for latch requests that had to wait. | mssql.average_latch_wait_time | CALCULATED | 0;m0-59s3 |
| Average latch wait time base | For internal use only. | mssql.average_latch_wait_time_base | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Average latch wait time raw | Average latch wait time (in milliseconds) for latch requests that had to wait. | mssql.average_latch_wait_time_raw | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Total average wait time | The average wait time, in milliseconds, for each lock request that had to wait. | mssql.average_wait_time | CALCULATED | 0;m0-59s3 |
| Total average wait time base | For internal use only. | mssql.average_wait_time_base | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Total average wait time raw | Average amount of wait time (in milliseconds) for each lock request that resulted in a wait. Information for all locks. | mssql.average_wait_time_raw | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Batch requests per second | Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput. | mssql.batch_requests_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Buffer cache hit ratio | Indicates the percentage of pages found in the buffer cache without having to read from the disk. The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After a long period of time, the ratio changes very little. Since reading from the cache is much less expensive than reading from the disk, a higher value is preferred for this item. To increase the buffer cache hit ratio, consider increasing the amount of memory available to MSSQL Server or using the buffer pool extension feature. | mssql.buffer_cache_hit_ratio | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Get Buffer Manager counters | The item gets server information about the buffer pool. | mssql.buffer_manager.raw | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Cache hit ratio | Ratio between cache hits and lookups. | mssql.cache_hit_ratio | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Cache object counts | Number of cache objects in the cache. | mssql.cache_object_counts | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Cache pages | Number of 8-kilobyte (KB) pages used by cache objects. | mssql.cache_pages | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Total errors per second | Number of errors per second. | mssql.errors_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Free list stalls per second | Indicates the number of requests per second that had to wait for a free page. | mssql.free_list_stalls_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Full scans per second | Number of unrestricted full scans per second. These can be either base-table or full-index scans. Values greater than 1 or 2 indicate that there are table / index page scans. If that is combined with high CPU, this counter requires further investigation, otherwise, if the full scans are on small tables, it can be ignored. | mssql.full_scans_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Get General Statistics counters | The item gets general statistics information. | mssql.general_statistics.raw | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Granted Workspace Memory | Specifies the total amount of memory currently granted to executing processes, such as hash, sort, bulk copy, and index creation operations. | mssql.granted_workspace_memory | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Index searches per second | Number of index searches per second. These are used to start a range scan, reposition a range scan, revalidate a scan point, fetch a single index record, and search down the index to locate where to insert a new row. | mssql.index_searches_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Errors per second (Info errors) | Number of errors per second. | mssql.info_errors_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Lazy writes per second | Indicates the number of buffers written per second by the buffer manager's lazy writer. The lazy writer is a system process that flushes out batches of dirty, aged buffers (buffers that contain changes that must be written back to the disk before the buffer can be reused for a different page) and makes them available to user processes. The lazy writer eliminates the need to perform frequent checkpoints in order to create available buffers. | mssql.lazy_writes_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Get local DB | Getting the states of the local availability database. | mssql.local.db.get["{$MSSQL.URI}","{$MSSQL.USER}","{$MSSQL.PASSWORD}"] | no type | no delay |

| Page lookups per second | Indicates the number of requests per second to find a page in the buffer pool. | mssql.page_lookups_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Page reads per second | Indicates the number of physical database page reads that are issued per second. This statistic displays the total number of physical page reads across all databases. As physical I/O is expensive, you may be able to minimize the cost either by using a larger data cache, intelligent indexes, and more efficient queries, or by changing the database design. | mssql.page_reads_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Safe auto-params per second | Number of safe auto-parameterization attempts per second. Safe refers to a determination that a cached execution plan can be shared between different similar-looking Transact-SQL statements. SQL Server makes many auto-parameterization attempts, some of which turn out to be safe and others fail. Note that auto-parameterizations are also known as simple parameterizations in the newer versions of SQL Server. This does not include forced parameterizations. | mssql.safe_autoparams_sec.rate | DEPENDENT | 0 |
