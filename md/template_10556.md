# Template: Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager by HTTP

## Template ID
10556

## Description
This template is designed to monitor Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager.

NOTE: The REST API may not be available for some editions, see (https://www.veeam.com/licensing-pricing.html) for more details.

Setup:
  1. Create a user to monitor the service, or use an existing read-only account.
     Similarly to the user authentication in the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager Web UI, 
     the client authentication in the REST API dictates which operations a client is allowed to perform when working with the REST API.
     That is, if the client is authenticated using an account that does not have enough permissions to perform some actions, it will not be able to execute them.
     You can also obtain the collected jobs if you are logged in under an account having only `Portal Administrator` role.
  See (https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/em_rest/http_authentication.html?ver=110) for more details.
  2. Link the template to a host.
  3. Configure the following macros: {$VEEAM.MANAGER.API.URL}, {$VEEAM.MANAGER.USER}, {$VEEAM.MANAGER.PASSWORD}.
