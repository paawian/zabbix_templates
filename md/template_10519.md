# Template: CockroachDB by HTTP

## Template ID
10519

## Description
The template to monitor CockroachDB nodes by Zabbix that works without any external scripts.
Most of the metrics are collected in one go, thanks to Zabbix bulk data collection.

The template collects metrics by HTTP agent from Prometheus endpoint and health endpoints.

Internal node metrics are collected from Prometheus /_status/vars endpoint.
Node health metrics are collected from /health and /health?ready=1 endpoints.
The template doesn't require usage of session token.

Note, that some metrics may not be collected depending on your CockroachDB version and configuration.

Setup:

Set the hostname or IP address of the CockroachDB node host in the '{$COCKROACHDB.API.HOST}' macro. You can also change the port in the '{$COCKROACHDB.API.PORT}' macro and the scheme in the '{$COCKROACHDB.API.SCHEME}' macro if necessary.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback
