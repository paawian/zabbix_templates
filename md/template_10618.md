# Template: Oracle Cloud Compute by HTTP

## Template ID
10618

## Description
This template monitors Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) single compute instance resources and discovers attached
virtual network interface cards (VNICs) and monitors their resources.

This template is not meant to be used independently, but together with Oracle Cloud by HTTP as a template for
LLD host prototypes.

Read the template documentation prior to using this template.

## Items

### Item: Get instance availability
- **Description**: The accessibility status of a virtual machine instance. A value of "1" indicates that the instance is unresponsive due to an issue with the infrastructure or the instance itself. A value of "0" indicates that an accessibility issue has not been detected. If the instance is stopped, then the metric does not have a value.
- **Interval**: 5m
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: CPU utilization, in %
- **Description**: Activity level from the CPU. Expressed as a percentage of the total time.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Disk read I/O
- **Description**: Activity level from I/O reads. Expressed as reads per interval.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Disk write I/O
- **Description**: Activity level from I/O writes. Expressed as writes per interval.
