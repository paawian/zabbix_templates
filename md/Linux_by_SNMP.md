# Linux by SNMP template description

This is an official Linux template. It requires an SNMP client.

MIBs used:
EtherLike-MIB
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
SNMPv2-MIB
UCD-DISKIO-MIB
UCD-SNMP-MIB
IF-MIB

Notes on filesystem (FS) discovery:
  - The ext4/3/2 FS reserves space for privileged usage, typically set at 5% by default.
  - BTRFS allocates a default of 10% of the volume for its own needs.
  - To mitigate potential disasters, FS usage triggers are based on the maximum available space.
    - Utilization formula: 'pused = 100 * (used / used + available)'
  - The FS utilization chart, derived from graph prototypes, reflects FS reserved space as the difference between used and available space from the total volume.
