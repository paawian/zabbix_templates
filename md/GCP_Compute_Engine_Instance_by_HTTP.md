| Guest visible vCPUs | Number of vCPUs visible inside the guest.<br>For many GCE machine types, the number of vCPUs visible inside the guest is equal to the `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` metric.<br>For shared-core machine types, the number of guest-visible vCPUs differs from the number of reserved cores.<br>For example, e2-small instances have two vCPUs visible inside the guest and 0.5 fractional vCPUs reserved.<br>Therefore, for an e2-small instance, `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/guest_visible_vcpus` has a value of 2 and `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` has a value of 0.5. | gcp.gce.cpu.guest_visible_vcpus | DEPENDENT | 0 |

| Scheduler wait time | Wait time is the time a vCPU is ready to run, but unexpectedly not scheduled to run.<br>The wait time returned here is the accumulated value for all vCPUs.<br>The time interval for which the value was measured is returned by Monitoring in whole seconds as start_time and end_time.<br>This metric is only available for VMs that belong to the e2 family or to overcommitted VMs on sole-tenant nodes. | gcp.gce.cpu.scheduler_wait_time | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| CPU usage time | Delta vCPU usage for all vCPUs, in vCPU-seconds.<br>To compute the per-vCPU utilization fraction, divide this value by (end-start)*N, where end and start define this value's time interval and N is `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` at the end of the interval.<br>This value is reported by the hypervisor for the VM and can differ from `agent.googleapis.com/cpu/usage_time`, which is reported from inside the VM. | gcp.gce.cpu.usage_time | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| CPU utilization | Fractional utilization of allocated CPU on this instance.<br>This metric is reported by the hypervisor for the VM and can differ from `agent.googleapis.com/cpu/utilization`, which is reported from inside the VM. | gcp.gce.cpu.utilization | DEPENDENT | 0 |
