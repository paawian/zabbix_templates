# Remote Zabbix server health template description

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the remote Zabbix server.

Specify the address of the remote Zabbix server by changing {$ZABBIX.SERVER.ADDRESS} and {$ZABBIX.SERVER.PORT} macros. Don't forget to adjust the "StatsAllowedIP" parameter in the remote server's configuration file to allow the collection of statistics.

Generated by official Zabbix template tool "Templator"
