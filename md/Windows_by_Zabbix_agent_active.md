## Items
| name | description | key | type | delay |
| ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Host name of Zabbix agent running | no description | agent.hostname | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 1h |
| Zabbix agent ping | The agent always returns "1" for this item. May be used in combination with `nodata()` for the availability check. | agent.ping | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Version of Zabbix agent running | no description | agent.version | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 1h |
| Cache bytes | Cache Bytes is the sum of the Memory\\System Cache Resident Bytes, Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes, Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes, and Memory\\Pool Paged Resident Bytes counters. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. | perf_counter_en["\Memory\Cache Bytes"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Free system page table entries | This indicates the number of page table entries not currently in use by the system. If the number is less than 5,000, there may be a memory leak or you running out of memory. | perf_counter_en["\Memory\Free System Page Table Entries"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Memory page faults per second | Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults, which require disk access, can cause significant delays. | perf_counter_en["\Memory\Page Faults/sec"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Memory pages per second | This measures the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults.<br>If the value is greater than 1,000, as a result of excessive paging, there may be a memory leak. | perf_counter_en["\Memory\Pages/sec"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Memory pool non-paged | This measures the size, in bytes, of the non-paged pool. This is an area of system memory for objects that cannot be written to disk but instead must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.<br>There is a possible memory leak if the value is greater than 175MB (or 100MB with the /3GB switch). Consequently, Event ID 2019 is recorded in the system event log. | perf_counter_en["\Memory\Pool Nonpaged Bytes"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Used swap space in % | The used space of swap volume/file in percent. | perf_counter_en["\Paging file(_Total)\% Usage"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU DPC time | Processor DPC time is the time that a single processor spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs). DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than standard interrupts. `% DPC Time` is a component of `% Privileged Time` because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. If a high `% DPC Time` is sustained, there may be a processor bottleneck or an application or hardware related issue that can significantly diminish overall system performance. | perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% DPC Time"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU interrupt time | The processor information `% Interrupt Time` counter indicates how much time the processor spends handling hardware interrupts during sample intervals. It reflects the activity of devices like the system clock, mouse, disk drivers, and network cards. A value above 20% suggests possible hardware issues. | perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% Interrupt Time"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU privileged time | The processor information `% Privileged Time` counter shows the percent of time that the processor is spent executing in Kernel (or Privileged) mode. Privileged mode includes services interrupts inside Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), executing Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs), Device Driver calls and other kernel-mode functions of the Windows Operating System. | perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% Privileged Time"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU user time | The processor information `% User Time` counter shows the percent of time that the processor(s) is spent executing in User mode. | perf_counter_en["\Processor Information(_total)\% User Time"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Context switches per second | Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.<br>Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.<br>It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.<br>There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. | perf_counter_en["\System\Context Switches/sec"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU queue length | The Processor Queue Length shows the number of threads that are observed as delayed in the processor Ready Queue and are waiting to be executed. | perf_counter_en["\System\Processor Queue Length"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Number of threads | The number of threads used by all running processes. | perf_counter_en["\System\Threads"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Number of processes | The number of processes. | proc.num[] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| CPU utilization | CPU utilization expressed in %. | system.cpu.util | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| System name | The host name of the system. | system.hostname | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 1h |
| System local time | The local system time of the host. | system.localtime | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Operating system architecture | The architecture of the operating system. | system.sw.arch | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 1h |
| Operating system | no description | system.sw.os | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 1h |
| Free swap space | The free space of the swap volume/file expressed in bytes. | system.swap.free | CALCULATED | no delay |
| Free swap space in % | The free space of the swap volume/file expressed in %. | system.swap.pfree | DEPENDENT | 0 |
| Total swap space | The total space of the swap volume/file expressed in bytes. | system.swap.size[,total] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| System description | System description of the host. | system.uname | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 15m |
| Uptime | The system uptime expressed in the following format: "N days, hh:mm:ss". | system.uptime | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | 30s |
| Get filesystems | The `vfs.fs.get` key acquires raw information set about the filesystems. Later to be extracted by preprocessing in dependent items. | vfs.fs.get | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Total memory | Total memory expressed in bytes. | vm.memory.size[total] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Used memory | Used memory in bytes. | vm.memory.size[used] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Memory utilization | Memory utilization in %. | vm.memory.util | CALCULATED | no delay |
| Windows: Network interfaces WMI get | Raw data of `win32_networkadapter.` | wmi.getall[root\cimv2,"select Name,Description,NetConnectionID,Speed,AdapterTypeId,NetConnectionStatus,GUID from win32_networkadapter where PhysicalAdapter=True and NetConnectionStatus>0"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Number of cores | The number of logical processors available on the computer. | wmi.get[root/cimv2,"Select NumberOfLogicalProcessors from Win32_ComputerSystem"] | ZABBIX_ACTIVE | no delay |
| Active agent availability | Availability of active checks on the host. The value of this item corresponds to availability icons in the host list.<br>Possible values:<br>0 - unknown<br>1 - available<br>2 - not available | zabbix[host,active_agent,available] | INTERNAL | no delay |
