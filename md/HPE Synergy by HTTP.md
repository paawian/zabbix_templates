# HPE Synergy by HTTP template description

This template is designed to monitor HPE Synergy by HTTP.
It works without any external scripts and uses the script item.

Setup:
  1. Link template to the host.
  2. Set the hostname or IP address of the host in the {$HPE.SYNERGY.API.HOST} macro and configure the username and password in the {$HPE.SYNERGY.API.USERNAME} and {$HPE.SYNERGY.API.PASSWORD} macros.
  3. Change the {$HPE.SYNERGY.API.SCHEME} and {$HPE.SYNERGY.API.PORT} macros if needed.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback/

Generated by official Zabbix template tool "Templator"
