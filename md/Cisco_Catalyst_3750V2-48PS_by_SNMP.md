| System contact details | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.  If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string. | system.contact | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System description | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>A textual description of the entity. This value should<br>include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and<br>networking software. | system.descr | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |

| Hardware serial number | MIB: ENTITY-MIB | system.hw.serialnumber | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| Uptime (hardware) | MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB<br>The amount of time since this host was last initialized. Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system. | system.hw.uptime | SNMP_AGENT | no delay |
| System location | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd floor').  If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string. | system.location | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| System name | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>An administratively-assigned name for this managed node.By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.  If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string. | system.name | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |
| Uptime (network) | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized. | system.net.uptime | SNMP_AGENT | no delay |
| System object ID | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'. | system.objectid | SNMP_AGENT | no delay |

These MIB objects are not accurate because they look at CPU at one minute and five second intervals, respectively. These MIBs enable you to monitor the trends and plan the capacity of your network. The recommended baseline rising threshold for cpmCPUTotal5minRev is 90 percent. Depending on the platform, some routers that run at 90 percent, for example, 2500s, can exhibit performance degradation versus a high-end router, for example, the 7500 series, which can operate fine.<br>Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/15215-collect-cpu-util-snmp.html | system.cpu.util[{#SNMPINDEX}] | SNMP_AGENT |
