# PHP-FPM by Zabbix agent template description

Get PHP-FPM metrics using Zabbix agent running on Linux.

Note that depending on your OS distribution, the PHP-FPM process name may vary. Please, check the actual name in the line "Name" from /proc/<pid>/status file (https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.0/manual/appendix/items/proc_mem_num_notes) and change {$PHP_FPM.PROCESS.NAME.PARAMETER} macro if needed.

Generated by official Zabbix template tool "Templator"
