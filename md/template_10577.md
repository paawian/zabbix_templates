## Items

### Item: Guest visible vCPUs
- **Description**: Number of vCPUs visible inside the guest.
For many GCE machine types, the number of vCPUs visible inside the guest is equal to the `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` metric.
For shared-core machine types, the number of guest-visible vCPUs differs from the number of reserved cores.
For example, e2-small instances have two vCPUs visible inside the guest and 0.5 fractional vCPUs reserved.
Therefore, for an e2-small instance, `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/guest_visible_vcpus` has a value of 2 and `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` has a value of 0.5.

### Item: Reserved vCPUs
- **Description**: Number of vCPUs reserved on the host of the instance.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: Scheduler wait time
- **Description**: Wait time is the time a vCPU is ready to run, but unexpectedly not scheduled to run.
The wait time returned here is the accumulated value for all vCPUs.
The time interval for which the value was measured is returned by Monitoring in whole seconds as start_time and end_time.
This metric is only available for VMs that belong to the e2 family or to overcommitted VMs on sole-tenant nodes.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: CPU usage time
- **Description**: Delta vCPU usage for all vCPUs, in vCPU-seconds.
To compute the per-vCPU utilization fraction, divide this value by (end-start)*N, where end and start define this value's time interval and N is `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores` at the end of the interval.
This value is reported by the hypervisor for the VM and can differ from `agent.googleapis.com/cpu/usage_time`, which is reported from inside the VM.
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: CPU utilization
- **Description**: Fractional utilization of allocated CPU on this instance.
This metric is reported by the hypervisor for the VM and can differ from `agent.googleapis.com/cpu/utilization`, which is reported from inside the VM.

### Item: Network: Received bytes: Load-balanced
- **Description**: Whether traffic was received by an L3 loadbalanced IP address assigned to the VM.
