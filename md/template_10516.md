# Template: OpenWeatherMap by HTTP

## Template ID
10516

## Description
Get weather metrics from OpenWeatherMap current weather API by HTTP.
It works without any external scripts and uses the Script item.

Setup:
  1. Create a host.

  2. Link the template to the host.

  3. Customize the values of {$OPENWEATHERMAP.API.TOKEN} and {$LOCATION} macros.  
      OpenWeatherMap API Tokens are available in your OpenWeatherMap account https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.  
      Locations can be set by few ways:
        - by geo coordinates (for example: 56.95,24.0833)
        - by location name (for example: Riga)
        - by location ID. Link to the list of city ID: http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz
        - by zip/post code with a country code (for example: 94040,us)
      A few locations can be added to the macro at the same time by "|" delimiter. 
      For example: 43.81821,7.76115|Riga|2643743|94040,us.
      Please note that API requests by city name, zip-codes and city id will be deprecated soon.
      
      Language and units macros can be customized too if necessary.
      List of available languages: https://openweathermap.org/current#multi.
      Available units of measurement are: standard, metric and imperial https://openweathermap.org/current#data.
