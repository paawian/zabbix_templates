# Template: Asterisk by HTTP

## Template ID
10336

## Description
The template gets Asterisk metrics from AMI by HTTP agent.
You should enable the mini-HTTP Server, add the option webenabled=yes in the general section of the manager.conf file and create Asterisk Manager user with system and command write permissions within your Asterisk instance.
Disable the PJSIP driver if you do not use PJSIP or do not have PJSIP endpoints.
Please, define AMI address in the {$AMI.URL} macro. Also, set the hostname or IP address of the AMI host in the {$AMI.HOST} macro for Zabbix to check Asterisk service status.
Then you can define {$AMI.USERNAME} and {$AMI.SECRET} macros in the template for using on the host level.
If there are errors, increase the logging to debug level and see the Zabbix server log.
