# Template: ClickHouse by HTTP

## Template ID
10323

## Description
This template is designed for the effortless deployment of ClickHouse monitoring by Zabbix via HTTP and doesn't require any external scripts.

Setup:

1. Create a user to monitor the service. For example, you could create a file '/etc/clickhouse-server/users.d/zabbix.xml' with the following content:

<yandex>
  <users>
    <zabbix>
      <password>zabbix_pass</password>
      <networks incl="networks" />
      <profile>web</profile>
      <quota>default</quota>
      <allow_databases>
        <database>test</database>
      </allow_databases>
    </zabbix>
  </users>
</yandex>

2. Set the hostname or IP address of the ClickHouse HTTP endpoint in the '{$CLICKHOUSE.HOST}' macro. You can also change the port in the '{$CLICKHOUSE.PORT}' macro and scheme in the '{$CLICKHOUSE.SCHEME}' macro if necessary.

3. Set the login and password in the macros '{$CLICKHOUSE.USER}' and '{$CLICKHOUSE.PASSWORD}'. If you don't need an authentication - remove headers from HTTP-Agent type items.
