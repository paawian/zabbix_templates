# Template: macOS by Zabbix agent

## Overview
This is an official macOS template. It requires Zabbix agent 7.0 or newer.

Notes on filesystem (FS) discovery:
  - The ext4/3/2 FS reserves space for privileged usage, typically set at 5% by default.
  - BTRFS allocates a default of 10% of the volume for its own needs.
  - To mitigate potential disasters, FS usage triggers are based on the maximum available space.
    - Utilization formula: 'pused = 100 - 100 * (available / total - free + available)'
  - The FS utilization chart, derived from graph prototypes, reflects FS reserved space as the difference between used and available space from the total volume.
