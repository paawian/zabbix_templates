# Template: RabbitMQ cluster by HTTP

## Template ID
10302

## Description
This template is developed to monitor the messaging broker RabbitMQ cluster by Zabbix that works without any external scripts.
Most of the metrics are collected in one go, thanks to Zabbix bulk data collection.

The template collects metrics by polling RabbitMQ management plugin with HTTP agent remotely.

Setup:

1. Enable the RabbitMQ management plugin. See the RabbitMQ documentation for the instructions:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html

2. Create a user to monitor the service:

rabbitmqctl add_user zbx_monitor <PASSWORD>
rabbitmqctl set_permissions  -p / zbx_monitor "" "" ".*"
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags zbx_monitor monitoring

3. Set the hostname or IP address of the RabbitMQ cluster host in the '{$RABBITMQ.API.CLUSTER_HOST}' macro. You can also change the port in the '{$RABBITMQ.API.PORT}' macro and the scheme in the '{$RABBITMQ.API.SCHEME}' macro if necessary.

4. Set the user name and password in the macros '{$RABBITMQ.API.USER}' and '{$RABBITMQ.API.PASSWORD}'.
