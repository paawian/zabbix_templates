# Template: Windows by SNMP

## Template ID

## Description
This is an official Windows template. It requires an SNMP client.

MIBs used:
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
SNMPv2-MIB
IF-MIB

Known Issues:

  Description:
    64-bit I/O is not supported even though `IfxTable` is present.
    Currently, Windows gets its interface status from MIB-2. Since these 64-bit SNMP counters (`ifHCInOctets`, `ifHCOutOctets`, etc.) are defined as an extension to IF-MIB, Microsoft has not implemented it.

- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: CPU utilization
- **Description**: MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
The average, over the last minute, of the percentage of time that processors was not idle.
Implementations may approximate this one minute smoothing period if necessary.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 0

### Item: System description
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
A textual description of the entity. This value should
include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and
networking software.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (hardware)
- **Description**: MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
The amount of time since this host was last initialized. Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System location
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
Physical location of the node (e.g., `equipment room`, `3rd floor`). If not provided, the value is a zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (network)
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
Time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System object ID
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Windows: SNMP walk mounted filesystems
- **Description**: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorage discovery.
- **Interval**: 1m
- **Data Type**: 4

### Item: SNMP agent availability
- **Description**: Availability of SNMP checks on the host. The value of this item corresponds to availability icons in the host list.
Possible values:
0 - not available
1 - available
2 - unknown
