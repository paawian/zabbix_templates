# Template: Linux by Zabbix agent

## Overview
This is an official Linux template\\. It requires Zabbix agent 7\\.0 or newer\\.

Notes on filesystem \\(FS\\) discovery:
\\- The ext4/3/2 filesystem reserves space for privileged usage\\, typically set at 5% by default\\.
\\- BTRFS allocates a default of 10% of the volume for its own needs\\.
\\- To mitigate potential disasters\\, FS usage triggers are based on the maximum available space\\.
  \\- Utilization formula: 'pused = 100 \\- 100 \\* \\(available / total \\- free \\+ available\\)'
\\- The FS utilization chart\\, derived from graph prototypes\\, reflects FS reserved space as the difference between used and available space from the total volume\\.
