## Template ID
10322

## Description
The template to monitor Elasticsearch by Zabbix that work without any external scripts.
It works with both standalone and cluster instances.
The metrics are collected in one pass remotely using an HTTP agent.
They are getting values from REST API '_cluster/health', '_cluster/stats', '_nodes/stats' requests.

Setup:

1. Set the hostname or IP address of the Elasticsearch host in the '{$ELASTICSEARCH.HOST}' macro.

2. Set the login and password in the '{$ELASTICSEARCH.USERNAME}' and '{$ELASTICSEARCH.PASSWORD}' macros.

3. If you use an atypical location of ES API, don't forget to change the macros '{$ELASTICSEARCH.SCHEME}','{$ELASTICSEARCH.PORT}'.
