## Items

| Name | Description | Data Type | Key | Tags |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----|------|
| Firmware version | MIB: FOUNDRY-SN-AGENT-MIB
The version of the running software in the form'major.minor.maintenance[letters]' | Unknown | system.hw.firmware | component:system |
| Hardware serial number | MIB: FOUNDRY-SN-AGENT-MIB | Unknown | system.hw.serialnumber | component:system |
| CPU utilization | MIB: FOUNDRY-SN-AGENT-MIB
The statistics collection of 1 minute CPU utilization. | Unknown | system.cpu.util[snAgGblCpuUtil1MinAvg.0] | component:cpu |
| System description | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
A textual description of the entity. This value should
include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and
networking software. | Unknown | system.descr[sysDescr.0] | component:system |
| ICMP ping |  | Unknown | icmpping | component:health, component:network |
| ICMP loss |  | Unknown | icmppingloss | component:health, component:network |
| ICMP response time |  | Unknown | icmppingsec | component:health, component:network |
| SNMP traps (fallback) | The item is used to collect all SNMP traps unmatched by other snmptrap items | Unknown | snmptrap.fallback | component:network |
| System contact details | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.  If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string. | Unknown | system.contact[sysContact.0] | component:system |
| System location | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
Physical location of the node (e.g., `equipment room`, `3rd floor`). If not provided, the value is a zero-length string. | Unknown | system.location[sysLocation.0] | component:system |
| System name | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
An administratively-assigned name for this managed node.By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.  If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string. | Unknown | system.name | component:system |
| System object ID | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'. | Unknown | system.objectid[sysObjectID.0] | component:system |
| Uptime (network) | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
Time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized. | Unknown | system.net.uptime[sysUpTime.0] | component:system |
| Memory utilization | MIB: FOUNDRY-SN-AGENT-MIB
The system dynamic memory utilization, in unit of percentage.
Deprecated: Refer to snAgSystemDRAMUtil.
For NI platforms, refer to snAgentBrdMemoryUtil100thPercent. | Unknown | vm.memory.util[snAgGblDynMemUtil.0] | component:memory |
| SNMP agent availability | Availability of SNMP checks on the host. The value of this item corresponds to availability icons in the host list.
Possible values:
0 - not available
1 - available
2 - unknown | Unknown | zabbix[host,snmp,available] | component:health, component:network |
| Uptime (hardware) | MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
The amount of time since this host was last initialized. Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system. | Unknown | system.hw.uptime[hrSystemUptime.0] | component:system |
