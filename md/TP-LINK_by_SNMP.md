Known Issues:

  Description: Default sysLocation, sysName and sysContact is not filled with proper data. Real hostname and location can be found only in private branch (TPLINK-SYSINFO-MIB). Please check whether this problem exists in the latest firmware: https://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/t2600g-28ts/#Firmware
  Version: 2.0.0 Build 20170628 Rel.55184 (Beta)

| System object ID | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'. | system.objectid[sysObjectID.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 15m |
