## Items

### Item: System contact details
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed
node, together with information on how to contact this person.  If no contact
information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: System description
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
A textual description of the entity. This value should
include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and
networking software.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (hardware)
- **Description**: MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
The amount of time since this host was last initialized.
Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB
[RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the
network management portion of the system.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System location
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet,
3rd floor').  If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: System name
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
An administratively-assigned name for this managed node.By
convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name.  If the name is unknown,
the value is the zero-length string.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: Uptime (network)
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The time in seconds since the network management
portion of the system was last re-initialized.
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Data Type**: 3

### Item: System object ID
- **Description**: MIB: SNMPv2-MIB
The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management
subsystem contained in the entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises
subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining 'what
kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor 'Flintstones, Inc.' was
assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1
to its 'Fred Router'.
- **Interval**: 15m
- **Data Type**: 1

### Item: SNMP traps (fallback)
- **Description**: The item is used to collect all SNMP traps unmatched by other snmptrap items
- **Interval**: 0
- **Data Type**: 2

### Item: SNMP agent availability
- **Description**: Availability of SNMP checks on the host. The value of this item corresponds to availability icons in the host list.
Possible values:
0 - not available
1 - available
2 - unknown
