# Nginx by HTTP template description

This template is developed to monitor Nginx by Zabbix that works without any external scripts.
Most of the metrics are collected in one go, thanks to Zabbix bulk data collection.

The template collects metrics by polling the module 'ngx_http_stub_status_module' with HTTP agent remotely:
https://nginx.ru/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html

Active connections: 291
server accepts handled requests
16630948 16630948 31070465
Reading: 6 Writing: 179 Waiting: 106

Setup:

1. See the setup instructions for 'ngx_http_stub_status_module':
https://nginx.ru/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html

Test the availability of the 'http_stub_status_module' with 'nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o with-http_stub_status_module'.

Example configuration of Nginx:

location = /basic_status {
    stub_status;
    allow <IP of your Zabbix server/proxy>;
    deny all;
}

2. Set the hostname or IP address of the Nginx host or Nginx container in the '{$NGINX.STUB_STATUS.HOST}' macro. You can also change the status page port in the '{$NGINX.STUB_STATUS.PORT}' macro, the status page scheme in the '{$NGINX.STUB_STATUS.SCHEME}' macro and the status page path in the '{$NGINX.STUB_STATUS.PATH}' macro if necessary.

You can discuss this template or leave feedback on our forum https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-suggestions-and-feedback/384765-discussion-thread-for-official-zabbix-template-nginx
