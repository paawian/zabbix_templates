  Device: UBNT UAP-LR

  Description: UBNT AirMax(NanoStation, NanoBridge etc) reports ifSpeed: as 0 for VLAN and wireless(ath0) interfaces
  Version: Firmware: XW.ar934x.v5.6-beta4.22359.140521.1836
  Device: NanoStation M5

  Description: UBNT AirMax(NanoStation, NanoBridge etc) reports always return ifType: as ethernet(6) even for wifi,vlans and other types
  Version: Firmware: XW.ar934x.v5.6-beta4.22359.140521.1836

| System contact details | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.  If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string. | system.contact[sysContact.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 15m |

| System description | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>A textual description of the entity. This value should<br>include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and<br>networking software. | system.descr[sysDescr.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 15m |
| Firmware version | MIB: IEEE802dot11-MIB<br>Printable string used to identify the manufacturer's product version of the resource. Maximum string length is 128 octets. | system.hw.firmware | SNMP_AGENT | 1h |

| Uptime (hardware) | MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB<br>The amount of time since this host was last initialized. Note that this is different from sysUpTime in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system. | system.hw.uptime[hrSystemUptime.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 30s |
| System location | MIB: SNMPv2-MIB<br>Physical location of the node (e.g., `equipment room`, `3rd floor`). If not provided, the value is a zero-length string. | system.location[sysLocation.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 15m |

This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining`what kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if vendor`Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'. | system.objectid[sysObjectID.0] | SNMP_AGENT | 15m |
